## üöÄ Getting Started: Booting Up the Sparklix Platform

Follow these steps to get all Sparklix microservices up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites:

*   **Java 17 JDK** (or newer compatible with Spring Boot 3.3.0) installed and configured (JAVA_HOME set).
*   **Maven 3.6+** installed and configured (MAVEN_HOME set, and `mvn` in PATH).
*   **MySQL Server** (version 8.x recommended) running locally.
    *   Default credentials expected: `root` / `1122`. Adjust `application.properties` in each service if different.
    *   The `admin-service` expects a user `sparklixadmin` with password `adminpass123` for its specific database (`sparklix_admin_db`). Ensure this user and privileges are set up if you don't rely on `ddl-auto: create` to make the DB user.
*   **Docker Desktop** installed and running (this is the easiest way to run RabbitMQ locally).
*   An IDE like **Spring Tool Suite 4 (STS), IntelliJ IDEA, or VS Code with Java extensions.**
*   **Git** for cloning the repository.

### Setup Steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd sparklix 
    ```
    (If working from a local folder, navigate to `C:\Users\Aniket\Downloads\sparklix`)

2.  **Start RabbitMQ (using Docker):**
    Open your terminal/command prompt and run:
    ```bash
    docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name some-rabbit -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:3-management
    ```
    *   This starts RabbitMQ detached (`-d`).
    *   AMQP port: `localhost:5672`
    *   Management UI: `http://localhost:15672` (default credentials: `guest` / `guest`)

3.  **Database Initialization (User Service - First Time Only):**
    *   Navigate to: `sparklix-user-service/src/main/resources/application.properties`
    *   **For the very first run OR if you need to completely reset `sparklix_user_db`:**
        Set `spring.sql.init.mode=always`
    *   Run `sparklix-user-service` once (see step 5). This will create/update tables and execute `data.sql` to populate roles (`ROLE_ADMIN`, `ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_VENDOR`) and default users.
    *   **IMPORTANT:** After this initial run and successful startup, **stop `sparklix-user-service` and revert `spring.sql.init.mode` back to `update` or `never`** in its `application.properties`. This prevents accidental data wipes on subsequent starts.

4.  **Build All Microservices with Maven:**
    From the root `sparklix` directory (where the parent `pom.xml` is):
    ```bash
    mvn clean install -DskipTests
    ```
    (`-DskipTests` can be used initially to speed up the build; ensure tests pass later).

5.  **Start Microservices (Strict Order is Crucial):**
    Open a **new terminal/command prompt for each service**. Navigate to its module directory (e.g., `cd sparklix-eureka-server`) and run its JAR:
    ```bash
    java -jar target/<service-artifact-name>-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
    ```
    (Replace `<service-artifact-name>` e.g., `sparklix-eureka-server`)

    *   **1. `sparklix-eureka-server`** (Port: `8761`)
        *   Wait for: `Tomcat started on port 8761` and `Started SparklixEurekaServerApplication`.
        *   Verify: Open `http://localhost:8761` in your browser. You should see the Eureka dashboard.

    *   **2. `sparklix-user-service`** (Port: `8081`)
        *   Wait for: `Tomcat started on port 8081` and successful registration with Eureka (check Eureka dashboard for `SPARKLIX-USER-SERVICE` listed as UP).

    *   **3. `sparklix-admin-service`** (Port: `8082`)
        *   Wait for: `Tomcat started on port 8082` and registration with Eureka (check dashboard for `ADMIN-SERVICE`).

    *   **4. `sparklix-api-gateway`** (Port: `8080`)
        *   Wait for: `Tomcat started on port 8080` and registration with Eureka.
        *   **CRITICAL:** Wait an **additional 30-45 seconds** after the gateway shows as UP in Eureka. This allows its internal client-side load balancer to fully initialize and discover other services.

    *   **5. `sparklix-notification-service`** (Port: `8086`)
        *   Wait for: `Tomcat started on port 8086` and registration with Eureka. Ensure MailerSend credentials are correct in its `application.properties`.

    *   **6. `sparklix-show-catalog-service`** (Port: `8083`)
        *   Wait for: `Tomcat started on port 8083` and registration with Eureka.
        *   Monitor its logs for `SYNC_CYCLE_START` and `SYNC_CYCLE_SUCCESS` (or `SYNC_CYCLE_END_EMPTY` if admin has no shows yet). This happens after an initial delay.

    *   **7. `sparklix-payment-service`** (Port: `8085`)
        *   Wait for: `Tomcat started on port 8085` and registration with Eureka.

    *   **8. `sparklix-booking-service`** (Port: `8084`)
        *   Wait for: `Tomcat started on port 8084` and registration with Eureka.

    üéâ Once all services are running and show as `UP` in the Eureka Dashboard, your Sparklix platform is ready for API testing!

## üß™ API Testing

Refer to the `sparklix_tests.md` file (or the "End-to-End User Flow Testing with Postman" section if you keep it here) for detailed steps on how to test the various functionalities using Postman.
Automated Python scripts for end-to-end testing are available in the `/api-tests` directory.

---

## üìö Documentation & Diagrams

*   **API Documentation (Swagger UI):** Each microservice exposes its API documentation via Swagger UI. Access it at `http://localhost:<service-port>/swagger-ui.html` (e.g., `http://localhost:8081/swagger-ui.html` for User Service).
*   **(TODO) Formal Design Diagrams:** UML Use Case, Class Diagrams, ER Diagrams, and Microservice Architecture diagrams will be added.

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Steps & Future Enhancements

*   Implement comprehensive Unit & Integration Tests (JUnit, Mockito).
*   Develop full Inventory Management for showtime seat availability.
*   Expand Vendor Portal functionalities (show submission, management, reporting).
*   Build out the `sparklix-analytics-service`.
*   Develop the Frontend User Interface.
*   Integrate SonarQube for continuous code quality analysis.
*   Enhance S2S security beyond shared service accounts (e.g., OAuth2 client credentials).
*   Explore SMS notifications via `sparklix-notification-service`.
